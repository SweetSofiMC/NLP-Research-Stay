# Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are fixed-length, dense, and distributed representations of words, formed based on distributional hypothesis, which propose that words with similar contexts have similar meaning. These embeddings encode syntactic and semantic information and are useful in various NLP tasks.

## Models

Word embeddings are categorized into the following categories:

- Prediction-based models
- Count-based models

Prediction-based models include various approaches like the log-linear model, hierarchical softmax, and negative sampling. Significant contributions to these models have been made by some researchers leading to models like CBOW and Skip-Gram​​.

Count-based models include methods like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL), and GloVe. These methods leverage word-context matrices to produce word embeddings​.

## Application:

There have been continuous efforts to improve the efficiency and performance of these models, leading to faster training times and better results in various NLP tasks​​.
Recent contributions to prediction-based models have focused on learning n-gram embeddings, which are especially effective in languages with rich morphology​

The field still requires further research to improve the performance of these models and to develop new models that can capture the complexity of language and produce better word embeddings.
