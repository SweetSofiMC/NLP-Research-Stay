# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**NLP Definition:** A field at the intersection of computer science and linguistics, aiming to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Levels of Language:** Phonetic, phonological, morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse levels.

## Approaches to NLP

- **Symbolic Approaches:**
  - Rely on manually created rules.
  - Use dictionaries and ontologies.
  - Example methods: CYC, WordNet.
- **Statistical Approaches:**
  - Depend on statistical models and machine learning.
  - Utilize large text corpora for training.
  - Example methods: N-grams, Hidden Markov Models.
- **Connectionist Approaches:**
  - Based on neural networks and deep learning.
  - Use both supervised and unsupervised learning.
  - Models can be recurrent or recursive.
## Comparison Among Approaches

- **Data Dependency:** Symbolic relies less on data; statistical and connectionist rely heavily on data.
- **Robustness:** Statistical and connectionist are generally more robust to noisy input than symbolic.
- **Flexibility:** Statistical and connectionist are more flexible and adapt better to new data.
- **Suitability:** More generally, different approaches are suited to different types of tasks.

## NLP Applications

- **Information Retrieval**: Finding relevant documents based on a query.
- **Information Extraction:** Extracting structured information from text.
- **Question-Answering:** Providing direct answers to user queries.
- **Summarization:** Condensing text while retaining main ideas.
- **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.
- **Dialogue Systems:** Engaging in conversation with users.
